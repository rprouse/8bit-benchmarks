# 8-Bit Benchmarks

As the early 8-Bit computers became more popular in the late 1970s and early
1980s, several computer benchmarks were released to compare the performance
of the BASIC programming language on these machines.

There were three common BASIC benchmarks in this era. The earliest, released in June 1977
were the [Rugg/Feldman benchmarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugg/Feldman_benchmarks)
which gained popularity in the UK. The [Byte Sieve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_Sieve)
released in September 1981 and the [Creative Computing Benchmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Computing_Benchmark)
first introduced in November 1983 were both more popular in the United States.

I am collecting these benchmarks here for easy reference and to benchmark the
various 8-Bit machines I build and own. Each benchmark is copyright their original
author. Anything else produced by me is under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
